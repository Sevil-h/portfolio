          <p class="text">BookArts is an AirBnb-clone developed in a team of three during a web development bootcamp at Le Wagon Istanbul in early 2021.
            Instead of a marketplace for real estate rental, BookArts is a marketplace for artwork.
            The idea is that it can help artists showcase their talent in peopleâ€™s homes while providing them with a source of revenue.
            On the other hand, the app also provides users an opportunity to temporarily spruce up their interior by renting
          the artwork they desire. Think of renting some antique sculptures for an Ancient Roman fancy dress party for example.</p>
